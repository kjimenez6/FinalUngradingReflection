I propose a C for my course grade.
Class Participation: The first half of the semester I wasn't attending any classes. By the second half of the semester I was attending a bit more classes. I had only missed two assignemnt versus the first half I missed quite a few. Due to my financial circumstances I had to miss fridays in order to be able to afford my bills and support myself. I tried to attend most mondays and wednesdays. I only missed a about two wednesdays due to a family emergency and having to take my uncle to his radiation appointments. I would be present in class and actively take notes during class and it's discussions. I struggled with time management and continued to try to keep track of everything. 
Code Quality: There was  one assignment that my code affected the Programmer's Pact. I rushed the assignemnt and had no motivation to do it plus was running out of time so I submitted what I coudl. The rest of my code assignements I tried to pay more attention and offer more time to it. I made sure to explain all the parts of the code and if the AI option on IntelliJ changed my code then I would research and make sure to know what that term did and what it meant. I would use Oracle Java documentations to research and confirm my knowledge on these terms. 
Midterm Reflection: My class attendance and homework submissions increased in the second half of the semester. I believe I began to manage work and school a bit more. I felt that I slacked a bit more during the beginning of the semester because I knew this was my last coding class for my degree, since I only need 271 I felt that I didn't have to focus too much on it. Yet, I understand the importance of it know because it is a pre-req for many of my future courses. My work and effort improved due to trying to motivate myself to work harder and better my time managemet with work.
